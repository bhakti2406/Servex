Distributed System Project - Run Instructions

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS


1. Install Python

Make sure Python 3.7 or later is installed.
You can download it from: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Install Required Packages

Open a terminal and run:

    pip install tkinter socket threading google-auth \
    google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 \
    google-api-python-client PyPDF2

3. Google Drive API Setup (One-Time)

To allow file operations using Google Drive:

a. Go to Google Cloud Console and enable the **Google Drive API**  
   https://console.developers.google.com/

b. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials and download `client_secrets.json`.

c. Place the `client_secrets.json` file in the project root directory.

d. When running the client for the first time, a browser window will open to authenticate.  
   After successful login, a `token.pickle` file will be generated for future sessions.


Step-by-Step Execution Instructions


1. Starting the Name Server

Run the name server which registers slaves and helps the primary server discover them.
Command:
     python Pyro4.naming -n <your_ip>

2. Connecting All Slaves One by One
Each slave connects to the name server and registers itself. Start each slave in a new terminal.
Commands:
    python slave1.py
    python slave2.py
    python slave3.py

3. Starting the Primary Server
Once all slaves are connected to the name server, start the primary server.
Command:
    python primary_server.py

4. Starting the Secondary Server
(If used for backup or additional communication, restart or ensure it is running.)
Command:
    python secondary_server.py

5. Starting the Client Application
Launch the GUI client to perform distributed operations.
Command:
    python client.py

6. Performing an Operation (e.g., Matrix Multiplication)
- On the client GUI, choose the Matrix Multiplication option.
- Upload or enter the matrix data as required.
- Submit the task to start distributed computation.
- The client sends the job to the primary server, which splits the task among slaves.
- The result is displayed on the GUI after completion.

 7. Performing Word Count

- On the client GUI, choose the Word Count option.
- You will be prompted to upload a `.txt` or `.pdf` file.
- The client extracts the text (PDFs are auto-converted).
- The text is sent to the **primary server**, which divides the workload among available slave nodes.
- Each slave counts words in its assigned chunk.
- The primary server collects and aggregates the results.
- The total word count is displayed on the client GUI.

Dependencies
- Python 3.7 or later
- Required Python packages:
    - tkinter
    - socket
    - threading
    - google-auth
    - google-auth-oauthlib
    - google-auth-httplib2
    - google-api-python-client
    - PyPDF2


Google Drive API Setup (for File Handling)

1. Enable Google Drive API in your Google Cloud Console.
2. Download `client_secrets.json` and place it in the root directory.
3. On first run, authenticate with your Google account.
4. A `token.pickle` file will be created for future access.


Directory Structure

- client.py              → GUI client application
- primary_server.py      → Main task coordinator
- secondary_server.py    → Backup Server
- slave1.py, slave2.py,
  slave3.py              → Worker nodes
- client_secrets.json    → Google API credentials
- token.pickle           → Auth token
- temp/                  → Temporary storage directory


Notes
- Make sure all scripts are running on the same network or properly configured with correct IPs.
- Matrix multiplication logic is invoked from the client.py GUI and processed across slaveX.py files via the primary server.
